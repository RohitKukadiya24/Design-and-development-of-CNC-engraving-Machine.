# Design-and-development-of-CNC-engraving-Machine.
ABSTRACT:

The CNC machine is abbreviated as Computer Numerical Control. The CNC machine is a
system that is able to accept numerical control inputs to machine a part specified by the
exact positioning of the inputs. It is referred to computer that changes the design in the
form of numbers and the computer functions to shape and cut the material. The CNC
machine includes three steps input, process and output. The production requires three
parts of the equipment. They are computer, an interface and computer numerical control.
This project would include building a machine which would perform functions like drilling,
boring, facing, engraving etc. It will be an automatic machine which would perform all the
above functions by automatically working according to the command given to the circuit.
These machines can be used to produce machine tools as well as control mechanism. This
machine includes some important parts such as stepper motor, a table, parallel port
breakout board, linear guide, spindle motor, etc. The software used to run this machine is 
EMC2 and MACH3. As name suggests the machine would be performing almost all
important functions so it would be an excellent substitute for various machines in one, it
would be the only machine which would do work of lathe, drilling, boring, etc. in one
machine. Thus it is very cost effective. This saves much of floor space compared to other
machines. The automatic system saves human effort and is easy to maintain. By using CNC
there is remarkable increase in the quality of products as well as it offers higher flexibility.
It increases the productivity and reduces the lead time. The production is economical in
nature and decreases the amount of scrap particularly for industries involved in mass
production.


INTRODUCTION:

The purpose of this project is to have a greater flexibility in operations. A CNC
machine is capable of doing operation with good efficiency. Computer Numerical
Control (CNC) is one in which the functions and motions of a machine tool are
controlled by means of a prepared program containing coded alphanumeric data.
CNC can control the motions of the work piece or tool, the input parameters such
as feed, depth of cut, speed, and the functions such as turning spindle on/off,
turning coolant on/off. This is a 4-axis machine.

PROBLEM
1. For mass production of intricate parts manual working becomes tedious. So optimization
of work should be needed. Thus automatic working is preferred over the manual work.
2. For making dyes or masterpieces a high level of acuity is required and as human work is
followed by some inaccuracies thus an automatic CNC machine is required.
3. In goldsmith works generally a goldsmith will consume more time in making a jewellery
and production rate will be low. A CNC machine would increase production rate by
increasing speed of production and accuracy is also high.
4. For manufacturing thousands of identical parts man working would not be able to
produce it, there would be some difference in each part. Thus automatic machine is
programmed in such a way that each part produced will be identical to each other.
5. Instead of using many men on different machine we could use single man on different
CNC machines which decreases labor requirement and reduces different machine
requirements for producing single part .

BRIEF PROBLEM SOLUTION OF PRESENT TECHNOLOGY:
In conventional CNC machine, the gantry mounting is lower mount which increases motion path . The tool motion is to be given to upper mount for increasing stability so in this project we will use upper mount of gantry so that the motion which is to be transferred to upper side will remain in upper side only.
In present type of CNC machine rigidity provided is little less due to use of less stable structure in manufacturing. While in this project we will use more stable structure by using C channel and upper mount gantry.
Mostly it is observed in conventional CNC machine that stability obtained is little less due to some unwanted tool motions or due to flexible structure of machine. Here in this project stability obtained is great due to balancing and eliminating unnecessary tool motion and necessary arrangement modification of parts in the machine.
A CNC machine available in market occupies more floor space while in this project we make our machine more compact and additional advantage of performing most of the functions in one machine.
In this project dual stepper motor is used which gives advantage of stability in Y axis while conventional machine is used only one stepper motor in one axis. The advantage of 4 axis over 3 axis is that in 4 axis we get benefit of operating round or circular parts while in 3 axis only flat surfaces are operated.
The controlling of this machine is done by USB which gives more advantages over conventional ones.

DESIGN OF MECHANICAL STRUCTURE
Refer books on mechanical parts and go through internet. Decide to make 4-axis CNC multi machine. Decide work envelope of machine and further start design through solidworks 3D modeling software.

DESIGNING CIRCUITS AND ITS ASSEMBLY
The circuits like wires, motors and transformers are mounted and connected together and connected to PC via software which work according to the information given to the computer.

MANUFACTURING OF PARTS AND ITS FINAL ASSEMBLY
Some parts like frame body, plates and fixtures were ordered from various local vendors and then welded, drilled and processed to join together to form a firm and rigid structure. The frame structure was welded in shop by us this structure is very rigid and stable because we used C structure which is very stable when analyzed by the inertia forces and moments calculation. After forming frame of the machine the parts like plates, bearings, motors, linear guide ways, shafts and circuits were ordered then positioned together and assembled in proper way to form a complete automatic CNC multimachine which could perform all the functions in one floor.

BALL SCREW AND RECIRCULATING NUT
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95118920/143781557-906826d6-6555-44e7-8d85-39bbf3d82019.png)

A ball screw is a mechanical linear Actuator that translates rotational motion to linear motion with little friction. A threaded shaft provides a helical raceway for ball bearings which act as a precision screw. As well as being able to apply or withstand high thrust loads, they can do so with minimum internal friction. They are made to close tolerances and are therefore suitable for use in situations in which high precision is necessary. The ball assembly acts as the nut while the threaded shaft is the screw. In contrast to conventional lead screws, ball screws tend to be rather bulky, due to the need to have a mechanism to re-circulate the balls. Dimension as per our design X axis – 600 mm travelling so length of ball screw is 760 mm Y axis- 450 mm travelling so length of ball screw is 610 mm Z axis – 300 mm travelling so length of ball screw is 460 mm
The diameter of all ball screw is 20 mm and pitch is 5 mm.

LINEAR GUIDEWAYS
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95118920/143781575-a93b30f4-8390-4892-975d-407425c44d73.png)

FUNCTION:- To support the ball screw and to components in motion DESCRIPTION:- A linear-motion bearing or linear slide is a bearing designed to provide free motion in one direction. There are many different types of linear motion bearings. Also called "ball slides," ball bearing slides are the most common type of linear slide. Ball bearing slides offer smooth precision motion along a single-axis linear design, aided by ball bearings housed in the linear base, with self-lubrication properties that increase reliability. It is one type of supporting member which support the linear motion members. For one axis we require two linear guide ways
Dimensions of shaft :- for ball screw in x axis we use 760 mm shaft and for y axis ball screw we use 610 mm shaft and for z axis ball screw we use 460 mm shaft

BEARING

FUNCTION:- A bearing is a machine element that constrains relative motion and reduces friction between moving parts to only the desired motion. DESCRIPTION:- The design of the bearing may, for example, provide for free linear movement of the moving part or for free rotation around a fixed axis; or, it may prevent a motion by controlling the vectors of normal forces that bear on the moving parts. Many bearings also facilitate the desired motion as much as possible, such as by minimizing friction. Bearings are classified broadly according to the type of operation, the motions allowed, or to the directions of the loads (forces) applied to the parts. In our project we use the two type of the bearings like SMA20&LMKUU bearings.The SMA20 type bearing is the square type bearing.The LMKUU type bearing is the round type bearing. They both are used for the different purposes.

COUPLING
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95118920/143781612-91f56fc7-527a-49de-97c6-db5daefc4455.png)

FUNCTION:-
A coupling is a device used to connect two shafts together at their ends for the purpose of transmitting power.
DESCRIPTION:-
The primary purpose of couplings is to join two pieces of rotating equipment’s while permitting some degree of misalignment and movement or both. By careful selection, installation and maintenance of couplings, substantial savings ca be made in reduced maintenance cost and downtime.
A rigid coupling is a unit of hardware used to join two shafts within a motor or mechanical system it may be used to connect two separate systems such as motor and generator, or to repair a connection within a single system. A rigid coupling may also be added between shaft to reduce shock and wear at the point where the shafts meet.
In our project we use ALS 40 COUPLING with sitting.

ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS

CONTROLLER BOARD
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95118920/143781628-453369ad-3550-4f95-9b68-6054e722bea0.png)

FUNCTION:-
To convert the signals received from the system to the drivers and ultimately drivers transfer signal to stepper motor.
DESCRIPTION:-
The USB interfaced CNC controller that was developed specifically to work with the CNC USB Motion Controller Software from www.planet-cnc.com. This Interface sports 4x 10 pin PBX-Header Connections for interfacing to our existing stepper motor drivers. It has an additional header for direct connection to our RBX-1 3 channel relay board.
This software/hardware combination can be further expanded with jog key inputs and an I2C bus for nearly unlimited additional I/O. This will allow the development of jog pendants, digital readouts, and input/output cards for a variety of purposes.
The software runs on Windows and replaces Mach3 or EMC2. It can even be run through a virtual machine on a Mac or Linux host. In our project we use USB 5 axis CNC breakout board for stepper driver controller.

STEPPER MOTOR
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95118920/143781645-c37f91d5-987a-4d4a-ad3f-82430f3f0abe.png)

FUNCTION: -
It provides increments in step rather than turning smoothly
DESCRIPTION: -
A stepper motor is essentially a servo motor that uses a different method of motorisation. Where a servo motor uses a continuous rotation DC motor and integrated controller circuit, stepper motors utilise multiple toothed electromagnets arranged around a central gear to define position

Stepper motors are available in two varieties; unipolar or bipolar. Bipolar motors are the strongest type of stepper motor and usually have four or eight leads. They have two sets of electromagnetic coils internally, and stepping is achieved by changing the direction of current within those coils. Unipolar motors, identifiable by having 5,6 or even 8 wires, also have two coils, but each one has a centre tap. Unipolar motors can step without having to reverse the direction of current in the coils, making the electronics simpler. However, because the centre tap is used to energise only half of each coil at a time they typically have less torque than bipolar.
The design of the stepper motor provides a constant holding torque without the need for the motor to be powered and, provided that the motor is used within its limits, positioning errors don't occur, since stepper motors have physically pre-defined stations.
In our project we use SY85STH65-4004A SOYO type and provide torque 34 KG per cm.

STEPPER MOTOR DRIVER
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95118920/143781665-c7f9808b-2fb9-460f-b1a2-527d3d19c975.png)
FUNCTION: -
It takes inputs from controller converts it into stepped signal and sends it to stepper motor
DESCRIPTION: -
The DRIVER is a complete microstepping motor driver and control system with a built- in translator. It is designed to operate uni-polar stepper motors in full-, half-, quarter-, eighth-, and sixteenth-step modes with output drive capability of 44V and 3.0 A. This driver utilizes the Sanken SLA7078MPR chip which includes built-in sense current detection and load circuit short or open protection provide lower loss and lower thermal resistance.

LIMIT SWITCH
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95118920/143781681-80759568-8897-4c10-9fcb-5683a361997d.png)
FUNCTION:-
IT provides limit to the signal or cut the signal when component touches it.
DESCRIPTION:- In electrical engineering a limit switch is a switch operated by the motion of a machine part or presence of an object. They are used for controlling machinery as part of a control system, as a safety interlocks, or to count objects passing a point.[1] A limit switch is an electromechanical device that consists of an actuator mechanically linked to a set of contacts. When an object comes into contact with the actuator, the device operates the contacts to make or break an electrical connection.

WORKING OF THE MACHINE

STEP – 1 INPUT OF G-CODE AND N-CODE
The part file is first converted into G code and N code this codes are fed in software of MACH3 and then run the program.
Now software give command to controller
STEP – 2 WORING OF CONTROLLER
The signals that come from the software are decoded and the feed to driver as input signal it controls the axis and every motion of machine. Limit switch is controlled with it and we can connect it with manual remote for controls. Controller gets power from DC supply of 5V.
STEP – 3 DRIVER
Driver takes input from controller and gives it to stepper motor and the RPM of motor is controlled with this signals. Driver gets power from power supply of 24 V and 5 A. it also saves stepper motor from shock circuit conditions.
STEP – 4 STEPPER MOTOR
It Converts electrical power into mechanical power driven with the help of stepper motor driver.
It connects with the linear motion guide or Ball screw with the help of coupling and it gives linear movement to the component.
STEP – 5 SPINDLE MOTOR
Its controlled by the controller. It holds tool holder and have high torque and the machining work is done by spindle motor.
Thus, the torque of this spindle motor is fed to tools and final operation of work piece is done.

CONSTRUCTION OF THE MACHINE
1. Frame structure :- Here in our machine we placed bolt screw on upper side of the frame as a result the whole gantry movement is done with less movable parts and rigidity is increased. It also increases accuracy of the machine.
2. Bolt screw and mountings :- As we mounted bolt screw at the top of the frame and on its mounting we include bearings and end support. Also we couple bolt screw with stepper motor with the help of shaft coupling.
3. Linear Guide way :- We use round bar guide way which provide support to gantry in linear motion.
4. Gantry :- We make gantry from aluminum plate which is less In weight and gantry is mounted on X-axis which reduces weight of machine.
5. Spindle motor :- It will be mounted on gantry with the help of bolt screw and linear guide way. It will be mounted on Z-axis. . Controller board :- It controls 5 axis of the machine and it gets power from power.
6. Controller board :- It controls 5 axis of the machine and it gets power from power supply and it will control the stepper motor by help of driver. It will be connected to PC and will run with the help of software.
7. Stepper motor driver :- Here one input is from the controller and another input is from power supply. First input will control the driver and second will run the stepper motor.
54
8. Stepper motor :- It is connected with driver and gets power from power supply. It will be of 4A and 25-40 volts. Stepper motor (or step motor) is a brushless DC electric motor that divides a full rotation into a number of equal steps. The motor's position can then be commanded to move and hold at one of these steps without any feedback sensor (an open-loop controller ), as long as the motor is carefully sized to the application.
9. Limit switch :- It will be at the end of the frame and the gantry when touches to
switch it will cut off driver power and stepper motor will stop.
